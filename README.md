Hello World!!

I am Faiz and I am new to github and would really like to learn more about it and work on some interesting projects so that I can build up my github account properly.

I have got an ample amount of coding experience in Java and I have also done coding in C++. I am planning on learning Javascript and for that I have had an experience in html and CSS as well.
